# Diamictite-Si-isotope-Mixing-Models

The isotope-oxide mixing models depicted in Figure 4 of "Homogenising the upper continental crust: the Si isotope evolution of the crust recorded by ancient glacial diamictites" were generated using these files, which were created in the open source computing platform Jupyter notebook. The inputs for each model are listed in Appendix A: Supplementary Material, which includes the sources for each parameter as well as the description of the Monte Carlo error propagation. The curves that bind each edge of the mixing polygons are based on the equations in Chapter 16 (Mixing Theory) of Isotopes: Principles and Applications (Faure and Mensing, 2004).
